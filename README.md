# Grocery_Online_Shopping_App
This is an example of NodeJS Microservices Architecture. I have built a simple Online Grocery Shopping Application using ES6 in a Monolithic way and segregate in Microservices Architecture without impact frontend. So each individual services will work independently to server the purpose and business logic. 
Underneath lays the complete transformed backend that serves this application using distributed systems.
